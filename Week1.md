##### Overview
###### Expectations
- 20 minute rule: I love to help people, so if you ask me a question, there's a good chance I will try to help you; however, don't let me!  Make sure you really try to solve the problem yourself and use your peers.  I am going to try to not answer a question unless at least 2 people come up!
- Respectful:  The Dojo has a lot of common space and with a lot of people in this cohort, it's easy for conversations to distract people, and for multiple conversations to grow louder and louder.  Let's work to keep the main space relatively calm.  If it get's too noisy, don't be offended if I gently remind people.
- Work ethic:  You are here to learn (I hope).  We ask a lot of you, and it can get discouraging at times.  Keep going, the more you work at it, the more you'll learn.  Become a coding ninja!
- Algorithms: Be involved - algorithms aren't just about getting the right answer, but as much about being able to communicate clearly with your colleagues about what you are trying to accomplish, identifying pitfalls, and thinking about things in ways that you might not have initially thought about them.  Get stuck?  It's ok to sit down and type out some code and try and figure out if/what you are trying to do works - but after you finish, get re-involved with your group!

##### How I Personally Learn: Some tips / maybe??
- A Use the scientific method:
  - Step 1: After or even while, reading through a chapter, test your understanding of it.
  - Step 2:  Make a hypothesis: e.g. the python print command causes html to render.
  - Step 3: Test hypothesis:  Type in my python shell: print "hello world" I might expect hello world to show on my html page.  (It doesn't)
  - Step 4: Analyze what happened - did your test succeed, did it fail
    - If it failed, consider why it failed and then go back to step 1.
    - If it succeeded, confirm success with successively more complicated trials.
  - Step 5: Fortunately this is a computer so we don't have to go the null hypothesis route, - behaviors are codified rather than unknowns - and if general tests work, more often than not, that was the programmed behavior.
  - After you get a basic understanding take a bit to search around on the interweb on the topic and see what else is out there.
- B Prepare to explain it:
  - Everytime I prepare to teach something, I gain insight into how that thing works.  For me the actual explaining is secondary (although that can help other people).  If I am trying to figure out how to explain it to someone else, whether I eventually do or do not, I almost always leave with a better understanding.  (But don't be shy to actually explain it to someone!)

###### Daily Schedule
- 9 am: Lecture, Demo - many of the lectures will be short 15 to 20 minutes.
- 9:20 - 11: Group project/Demo, individual work (in later weeks)
- 11 - 12: algorithms
- 12 - 1: Lunch   
- 1: Stand-up: A quick synapsis of what you are currently working on, or plan on working on for the day.
- 1:15 - 5:30: Work through the platform.
- 5:30pm : Everyday there will be one or a set of assignments to push to Github and then post your - github link to Slack.  This is required.  It doesn't matter if the assignment that you push is completely blank - push that blank assignment!  
- Look through the github repos!  See something cool, implement it!  See something that you can help fix, fork it, fix it, pull request it!  Haven't done the assignment - here's the fun part:
Fork or clone someone's assignment.  Copy it, don't copy and paste it, but type it out!  Run it - most likely your copying will introduce new errors (I personally am a horrible typer), fix those errors, talk yourself through what is going on, get that assignment DOWN, you can even make a video of yourself explaining your code.  Repeat w/ at least 2 of your colleagues repos!  Don't be shy about this, since everyone is pushing, you might be able to identify other people who are also struggling - work through things together.  You expected to be working 60 + hours a week right??
- 6:15 - 9 Work work work!  

###### Working ahead?: Do it!
Cruising through the material?  Keep going, but definitely don't skip the optional assignments if you are ahead!!! Also take a glance at the assignment list - a lot of the group assignments are from the platform, so if you don't want to duplicate too much effort, take note of that.  Do still push the appropriate assignment to GitHub at the appropriate time though.
- Python is a great track to work ahead on, Django is a second framework (flask being the first) that a lot of web-developers use and initially for many early developers it can feel overwhelming so it is great to play with while you are around other people working through it.  It's fun - it emphasizes good design principles and will make you a better Python dev.  Every cohort a few students end up taking the exam in Django - it's great to see!  You can do it!

###### Take Breaks
Sports day is Thursday, but get up and take a brief walk every 1 - 2 hours.  Even if it is just up and down the stairs.
